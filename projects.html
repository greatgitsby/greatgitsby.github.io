		<h1>Projects</h1>
		The following is a collection of projects I have worked on in the past for both
		university, current, and past jobs. Any source code that is publicly available can be found
                <a href='https://github.com/greatgitsby' target='_blank'>on my GitHub</a>.

		<a href='https://gfuprojects.com' target='_blank'><h2>GFU EPIC Website</h2></a>
		This website is for my Servant Engineering project during my third year at Fox. We created a workflow
		and set of resources for teachers at a local high school to submit project ideas and have us create what
		they had envisioned. The source is located <a href='https://github.com/greatgitsby/gfu-project-site' target='_blank'>here</a>.

		<h2>Client Dashboard</h2>
		I built a dashboard for <a href='https://simplemonitors.com/' target='_blank'>Simple Monitors</a> clients to manage their webhook configurations, authentication, and release channels. It leverages HTML/CSS/jQuery and is served by a simple Node.js application and it runs on a simple Heroku configuration.
		
		<h2>Monitor Management Dashboard</h2>
                I built a dashboard for internal management of sites and products monitored by our web scraping platform. Each site 
                'platform' has a dedicated page to display its active configurations and perform C.R.U.D. operations

		<h2>Web Scraper Platform</h2>
		The management dashboard would hold very little value without the scraping platform itself. I created a fully distributed scraping platform to monitor product additions and restocks. The platform is backed by a Kubernetes cluster and leverages technologies like Redis, an MPI-like layer on top of Redis, and various Node.js microservices.
