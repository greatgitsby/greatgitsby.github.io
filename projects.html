		<h1>Projects</h1>
		The following is a collection of projects I have worked on in the past for both
		university and work.

		<a href='https://gfuprojects.com' target='_blank'><h2>GFU EPIC Website</h2></a>
		This website is for my Servant Engineering project during my third year at Fox. We created a workflow
		and set of resources for teachers at a local high school to submit project ideas and have us create what
		they had envisioned.

		<h2>Client Dashboard</h2>
		Built a dashboard for Simple Monitors clients to manage their webhook configurations, authentication, and release channels.
		
		<h2>Monitor Management Dashboard</h2>
		Coming soon...

		<h2>Web Scraper Platform</h2>
		Built On Kubernetes

		Coming soon...
